# Buffon's Needle Simulator #
This is a Java MVC program I created for my Software Design course at Carleton College. It uses the JavaFX GUI library.

The [Buffon's Needle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon%27s_needle) problem approximates pi by throwing a bunch of sticks onto a slatted floor. It's pretty cool.
