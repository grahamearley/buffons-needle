### Brief intro:
After learning about and becoming fascinated with Buffon's Needle in my Probability 
course, I decided to create this MVC program to simulate the experiment. The program
sets up a board environment with slats that are the needle's length apart from each 
other and allows the user to add needles and see an approximation of pi!

### Status of the program:
The program currently works as I had originally conceived. All desired features are
implemented and functional. I also added a bit of "Help" information (beyond what was in
my mockup) in order to make the program more friendly toward people who haven't heard
of Buffon's Needle.

### Implementation of MVC:
- Model: the model stores the simulation information, such as the needles on
  the board, the intersections, and the approximation of pi.
- View(s): the program has two views:
    - The board view displays a board with the needles on it (color-coded
      by intersection status).
    - The number view displays text that tells the user how many needles are 
      on the board, how many intersections there are, and, of course, the 
      estimation of pi.
- Controller: the controller coordinates the updating of the model and views,
  taking input from the user where necessary (namely, for needle tosses).



### Core classes:
- Needle
    - contains position, length, and angle information
        - the position and angle information is percentage based:
          the values are completely relative, allowing the needles
          to be placed within any window.
    - creates the JavaFX Line object within a window.
- Model
    - stores needle positions and allows needles to be added
    - stores the dimensions of the board (for calculations)
    - stores number of slats (and calculates their positions based on
      the board width)
    - calculates number of intersections between needles and slats
